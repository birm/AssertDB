# AssertDB
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/AssertDB.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/AssertDB)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/birm/AssertDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/birm/AssertDB)
A Database Precondition and Assertion Tool

## Why
Assertions are useful for any environment, as checking assumptions provides information on how to proceed.
Databases are no exception.
This tool allows for quick checks of assertions, and allows for use ranging from notifications via cron runs, to programatic checks for deployments.

## How to use
Write a query, its desired result, and a on-fail notification method.

## Hopeful Features
* File input
* More CI Testing
